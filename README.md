This document describes how the script works and also includes the code book describing the variables.

The script does , step by step, the requirements of the project.
It assumes that the Samsung data is already in your working directory.
It also needs the dplyr package and its dependencies installed.

For the step 2(Extracts only the measurements on the Mean and standard deviation for each measurement) 
the data only includes fit raw Mean and standard deviation from the Samsung data set variables. What include or not was open to interpretation, so I decided that it was only required the raw data.

The descriptive names are all mentioned in the data dictionary("CodeBook.md").
The result file is also included in this folder("project_results.txt") 
It can be generated running the script "run_Analysis.R".
